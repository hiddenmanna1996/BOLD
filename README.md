# BOLD
Welcome to the Bayesian Ordered Lattice Design (BOLD) application. This application was developed to aid in the dose selections during Phase I clinical trials. This application is specifically intended for single-drug trials, allowing for a maximum of five dose levels, (i.e., the maximum lattice is "1x5"). Users have the option to either actively conduct a clinical trial or to perform a simulation.

When users execute the code, a user-friendly interface will appear, and several questions will be posed for users to provide essential information. The outcomes of the dose selections made during the clinical trial or the summary of simulation will be presented once the "Start" button on the screen is activated. Error messages will be displayed if the information provided by the users is incorrect.
